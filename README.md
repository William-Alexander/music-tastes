# music-tastes

For the purpose of practicing BeautifulSoup usage and to satisfy my curiosity about how different people perceive the quality of musical albums, I'm going to be comparing ratings given by multiple different ratings sites/people. In particular, since I was inspired while watching one of his videos, they'll all be compared to the man himself, Anthony Fantano. 

Sites to be included so far:

- Needle Drop
- Pitchfork 
- Metacritic
- Sputnikmusic if I can figure out how to submit a god damn form
